			<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup with
			<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a> to add tools like Tailwind,
			React, or Vue to your project.
		</p>
		<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
			<li>Edit the site header items in <code>src/components/Header.astro</code></li>
			<li>Add your name to the footer in <code>src/components/Footer.astro</code></li>
			<li>Check out the included blog posts in <code>src/content/blog/</code></li>
			<li>Customize the blog post page layout in <code>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
